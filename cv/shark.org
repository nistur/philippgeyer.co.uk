We had received a spec from the publisher, along with some feature
protype projects, which gave the basis for this game. It was intended
to be played on mobile VR, and we were to use head motion to control
the movement of the shark.

One of the major tasks I undertook on this project was to develop the
AI for all the other fish and sea creatures. Given the relatively fast
paced nature of the game, it was acceptable for them to be somewhat
simplistic, but they had to be seen to flock, or hunt, or run away. A
major limitation of this was that the level was pretty open, so to
have it feel interesting, we ended up having several thousane AI
entities. For this reason, I designed the system in order to be able
to balance the work done, so we could get reliable updating, but did
not overpower the device.

Related to the performance, it was difficult to establish what was
causing us problems a lot of the time, so I wrote a debug profiling
system, which would track the performance and write it to a file,
along with information such as the current facing direction, and camera
field of view. With this information, I could then use it offline to
generate a 3D heatmap of frame time, allowing us to identify problem
areas and address them individually.
