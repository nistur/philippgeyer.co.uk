As with the earlier game I worked on, [[url_for:cv,slug=01][Lara Croft and the Guardian of
Light]], we were working to recreate a console and PC title on
mobile. The studio had previously already worked on Call of Duty:
World at War Zombies, so we begun with that project as a start.

Given the amount of UI that I had done on previous projects, I
requested to work on other things as well. As such, I had a bit more
experience on this game, working with all the different systems. This
included writing a lot more set piece scenarios, as well as
implementing fast lookup systems for interactables on the large maps.

Regarding UI, one of the reasons that I managed to do so little,
despite being the developer with the most UI implementation
experience, and having the closest working relationship with the UI
artists, was that I had discovered a project called [[http://tulrich.com/textweb.pl?path=geekstuff/gameswf.txt][gameswf]]. I spent
two weeks integrating it with our in house rendering and asset
management systems, and then provided support throughout the rest of
the project for actionscript bugs, as well as optimising the rendering
by, for example, replacing the internal font rendering with hooks into
our own optimised bitmap font rendering systems. Overall, this allowed
the artists far more flexibility to create dynamic menu systems, and
allowed me to work on other game features.
