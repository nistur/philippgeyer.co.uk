This project spanned the entirety of my time at FreeStyleGames as
it went through a number of iterations before we settled on the final
implementation. The premise was that it would be a companion app which
would supplement the gameplay of the main game. It had planned
features such as touch guitar and drum gameplay, an program guide for
GHTV, scheduling alarms, which could be shared with friends to play
alongside them. We also experimented with using the device's
microphone to be able to sing the vocals of any tracks. Due to a
number of reasons unrelated to the development, the only feature that
ever shipped was the microphone.

The app was predominantly written in Unity, but we did leverage
several libraries and systems from the main game, to save rewriting
them from C++ into C#. As such I had a number of tasks which were
related to creating the interface between the systems, and ensure that
they were working correctly. I was handled the markup parsing, and
gameplay features of the touch modes, as well as the majority of the
UI.
