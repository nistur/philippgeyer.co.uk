This project was already well in development by the time I joined the
studio. One of my initial tasks was to do a review of the codebase and
suggest improvements. From there, I implemented a few changes, and
refactored a bit.

The immediate issue was performance, there were several systems in the
game which caused significant issues in both editor and runtime
performance. This involved getting quite deep into the Unity profiling
tools and picking apart the codebase to identify the issue, before
proposing solutions to solve the problems, liasing with the team to
establish potential issues with it, and implementing the new
redesigns.

One other issue established early on was that the game was not being
coded defensively, and was throwing errors very frequently. Unity
helpfully tries to ignore these and continue executing. This was
causing some odd bugs, so I implemented a similar BSoD that I created
for the [[url_for:cv,slug=10][Guitar Hero Live Companion App]], which initially got some
pushback from the rest of the team, but was quickly accepted as being
a useful tool to remain enabled.
