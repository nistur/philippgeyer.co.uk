Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was a 3rd person action adventure
game originally made for PC and console. My first project while at
Ideaworks Game Studio, was to work on a recreation of this game for
mobile platforms.

The game was written with in house tech, in C++. We had access to
console game assets, but we created mobile optimised assets for use in
the game.

My work in the game involved implementing game systems for setpiece
objects, multiplayer programming, and setting up an extensible UI system.

We were using an in house UI solution, which used a C-style layout
language. One of my main jobs was to work with this system, making
custom widgets, as well as a library of reusable components with which
we could quickly develop the UI, and share resources between
locations.
