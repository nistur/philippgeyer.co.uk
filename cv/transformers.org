Transformers was built on top of the technology we already had in
place from [[url_for:cv,slug=01][Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light]] so it really felt like
we hit the ground running with this one. As with before I tried to get
involved with every part of the development, but again fell in with
the UI.

One task I had was to  update to a new UI system that provided a
little more flexibility. Unfortunately there were also a number of
issues with the system in the way of bugs and missing features, so I
worked closely with the developer who created the new UI solution to
identify the problems, and improve it.

Additionally, I wrote the vehicle handling for the transformers. I
tried a few different handling models until we decided that the
simplest one felt the best with the gameplay, and the mobile touch
controls. I also created tools for designers to be able to tweak the
handling.
