I joined this project in the gameplay team, and I ended up working on
a number of systems, including UI and input. This was a really fun
project, as it was a game series that I grew up loving, and Guitar
Hero: Live added some really cool new features.

Among other things, this was also my first attempt to use console dev
hardware, and I was set up to develop and test on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii-U
and iOS. I did the majority of my console development at the time on
the PS3 though.

The development time on the game was sometimes not the easiest, with
ubiquitous crunch rearing its head, as well as a plethora of bugs,
which were complicated by the multiple platforms, online capabilities,
and peripherals, but I feel I learned a lot from the experience, and
really enjoyed it.
