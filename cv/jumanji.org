One of my first tasks, and an ongoing one, was to provide support for
the game to run on Nintendo Switch. Prior to this it had only been
tested on PC, and on Sony PS4. As such, it took a good deal of
optimisation to run at anything resembling a reasonable
framerate. This involved playing around with the Unreal profiling
tools, as well as writing some profiling systems myself, and liaising
with, usually artists, to get compromises working which would be
acceptable as a final product.

I didn't find myself doing too much feature work on Jumanji,
unfortunately, as a lot of my time was spent managing the team,
liaising with art and design to make sure they got what they wanted, when
they needed it, and what little time I did get was mostly spent
optimising performance and bug fixing.

This project was a first for me in many ways, including the first time I
used Unreal's Blueprints properly, and the first time that I was
involved with the submission of a console game to first parties.
