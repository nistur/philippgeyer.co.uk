This project was to create two small games to tie in with Disney Cars
and Planes movies, targetted at young children. The game itself was
intended to be a free download, and the developer would sell plastic
steering wheels and flight yokes which would hold the mobile device
in it.

I set up a project that we could use for both games, and would share a
lot of things such as UI flow, scoring, and input. The vehicle
handling was developed following a path, for both Cars and Planes.
