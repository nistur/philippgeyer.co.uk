I helped support the UI for the China only Call of Duty Online. For
this I worked in Flash to make the UI in Scaleform, working on
supporting the metagame systems, working in a flexible way that could
be easily updated and changed based on server events.

This was my first exposure to working in Scaleform itself, and was
interesting to see this and compare it with my use of GameSWF, as we
used in a [[url_for:cv,slug=03][previous game]].
