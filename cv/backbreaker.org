We contracted an external company to develop Backbreaker 2, based on
our original Backbreaker codebase. We did still have a few people
in-house working on the project though. One of my tasks was to oversee
the external developers' work and perform code reviews. I also created
a few custom UI pages and elements. These would be used as prototypes
that the external developers could use to create the remaining UI.

One of the more interesting tasks was to generate new animation
sets. While we didn't have enough processing power to use
NaturalMotion's full animation system, we did use it offline to
generate canned animations, and worked with their runtime libraries to
still get some of the feeling of the physics based animations of the
console titles.
