The goal for this app was to have Mickey and Minnie's face on the
mobile device, which would be able to perform actions like talk to the
user and play mini games with them. The face would slide into a plush
designed for it, to give the user the experience of being able to play
with their favourite characters.

This was the only project I've ever done using Cocos2D-X which was
interesting. Unfortunatly this was cancelled before it got completed
for licensing issues.
