We were working on a companion app for Call of Duty Ghosts. The
intention of the section we were working on was to create a map view
for the Squads game mode, which would allow players to get a birds eye
view of how their team was playing, call in air strikes and command
their squad. 

This project was developed in Unity and intended to communicate with
the main game over the standard Call of Duty networking services. We
worked on a protocol with the main game team and implemented the app
side. We generated sample game data, based on the protocols we have
agreed on and were able to develop and test using that.

Unfortunately the app was never released, as we were not able to get
the support to get the protocol implemented in the main game. It was
still a very interesting project, to work on such a different kind of
game system.
