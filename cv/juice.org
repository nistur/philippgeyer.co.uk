This was a project, which should allow for iOS obj-c apps to be
deployed to Android. We were doing it primarily for a client who had a
top grossing iOS app and wanted to release on Android without having
to rewrite the entire game, and maintaining two codebases.

We then created an obj-c layer which would sit on top of our cross
platform tech and would allow for it to be run on Android, or in
theory any of the many supported platforms. Overall the project was
very interesting, and seemed to work pretty well. It was also very
interesting as it involved working with obj-c, C++, and also a little
Java for some of the Android specific code, as well as working with
the underlying systems to be able to match the functionality.
