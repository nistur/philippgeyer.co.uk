This was my first experience using Unity, rather than our in house
tech that we had used for previous projects. It was certainly a
learning experience, as I was far more used to getting stuck in with
lower level problems, while Unity allowed me to worry mostly about
far different issues.

One of my tasks in this game was to implement the UI system. However,
unlike previous games, there wasn't an easy UI solution at the time,
so instead we made use of far more 3D UI elements than we ever could
before. Connected with this, I also worked on the input handling, and
how that controlled the character.
