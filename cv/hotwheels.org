We were asked to help another studio out with some work on the
Hotwheels ID line. This involved having RFID sensors in certain cars,
and a smart track to detect their position speed etc. I helped a
little on the maintenance of their main Hotwheels ID app, but mostly I
was working on the development of a new app, aimed at younger
children, to go alongside their Ultimate Garage playset.

I worked with designers to come up with feasible minigames that could
be played, and implemented prototypes to test them out.
