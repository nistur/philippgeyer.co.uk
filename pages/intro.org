#+TITLE: Intro
Hello internet travelers, citizens and natives.

Nice to meet you, I'm Philipp Geyer. I am a programmer and this is my
site. It will have information about my various projects and
history. I've worked on a bunch that I find very interesting, and
think it's worth documenting. I also have a few personal projects that
I think should have something written.

I usually code in high level C++ and C# professionally, and in my
personal projects, I often use low level C, but also enjoy jumping
around languages. I have projects in lisp, assembly, C, lua and
bash. I also enjoy experimenting with other languages, so have many
more not shared just for the sake of experimenting with the languages.

If you're wanting to look at my past experience, [[https://github.com/nistur/cv/releases/latest][my CV is available on
github]] and I have [[url_for:cv,slug=00][a short writeup on each project]] I've worked on.
