#+TITLE: About
* Who are you?
  Philipp Geyer

* No, Who are you? More information please.
  I am programmer, coder, software engineer, developer, whatever you
  want to call me. I have spent a decade in video game development,
  and recently have been working on enterprise software.

* What is the point of this website?
  In part to contain information I'd like to put about myself, which
  [[url_for:cv,slug=00][won't fit on my CV]], in part to just have a place to ramble about
  stuff. Some of it might be insightful, if I'm lucky.

* Your CV? Where can I find that?
  [[https://github.com/nistur/cv/releases][On my github]]

* Why are there so many files?
  To be honest, just download the [[https://github.com/nistur/cv/releases][latest]] PDF. If you're interested in
  the other stuff, read [[file:cv.org][this]] writeup.
